       <b> Importance of Chemistry in Everyday Life:</b> The scientific study of matterâ€™s properties and behavior is known as <b>Chemistry.</b> 
        It is a natural science that studies the elements that makeup matter, as well as the compounds, made up of atoms, molecules,
         and ions: their composition, structure, qualities, and behavior, as well as the changes that occur when they mix with other things.

        In this article, we have provided the <strong> <ins>importance of chemistry in everyday life, including 
            the uses and applications of various compounds of chemistry and how Chemistry affects our daily life.</ins></strong>

    <p>Chemicals are the fundamental components of everything. 
        Chemical molecules make up all food, including <b> <mark>carbs, vitamins, lipids, proteins, and fiber,</mark> </b> which are all safe and often desirable.
        Some of the basic chemistry formulas are NH<sub>3</sub> (Ammonia), CO<sub>2</sub> (Carbon dioxide), CH<sub>4</sub> (Methane), SO<sub>2</sub> (Sulfur dioxide).
